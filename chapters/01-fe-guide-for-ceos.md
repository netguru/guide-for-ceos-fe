# Frontend Development - Quick Guide for CEOs

## What is frontend and why it’s important for your business

Frontend is everything that the user sees and interacts with. It doesn't matter what problems your business solves - you won’t attract customer without a well-done frontend. It creates the first impression in your user’s mind - and, as they say, the first impression is the last impression.

Nowadays, we are getting more and more impatient. You probably remember closing a site because it took long to load. There is even an worse scenario, when you can see a page, but cannot interact with it due to a badly developed user interface. Lost customers equals less revenue - Amazon calculated that increasing the page load time by one second could [cost them 1.6$ billion in sales each year](https://www.fastcompany.com/1825005/how-one-second-could-cost-amazon-16-billion-sales). Slowing down Google search results by only four tenths of a second might equal losing 8 million searches per day. Keep in mind that, even if you have cutting-edge business logic running on your servers, a slow frontend might cost you an arm and a leg.

Today, more than half of web traffic comes from mobile phones and tablets ([source](https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/vital-internet-trends/)). This traffic is a big conversion potential - more than 70% of smartphone users made a purchase online ([source](https://www.outerboxdesign.com/web-design-articles/mobile-ecommerce-statistics)). Your website has to be optimised for a great mobile experience. There is another big player in the game - Progressive Web Applications (PWA), which can give a great performance boost thanks to extensive caching. It might even allow your web app to **work offline**. If you ever tried to browse the web while riding the metro or a train you must agree - this is a game changer.

But remember - with great power comes great responsibility. You might be tempted to use all the state-of-art features just for the sake of being modern. When your website is full of features that don’t work properly on all browsers, you might lose some of your customers. It's very important to **know your audience** and make sure that they won't suffer - because in the end it's not so easy to please everyone.

## Pains and Pitfalls of Frontend Development

## What can go wrong with technology

### Framework and maintenance

A frontend framework is a well structured fundament - a set of plug-and-play, widely tested, common solutions you can effortlessly reuse to create more features.
Frameworks speed up development and allow you to produce code that is understandable and easily extendable. And what is more important, it can be tested to work as expected.

What are the options in 2019? There are three worth considering:

- React
- Vue
- Angular

_“Why only these three? I know that X company used Y and this technology is not listed here!”_

When choosing a frontend framework, you need to consider the following factors:

- Maturity of the solution
- Current popularity
- Community size
- Solutions available out-of-the-box
- Available developers
- Developer experience

Let’s take a look at Angular.js, the older brother of Angular. It’s mature, and it was popular at a point in time. But at the moment it is not actively developed anymore. The community is shrinking and it’s getting harder to find skilled developers to maintain and improve applications built on top of Angular.js. In the end, development takes more time and is more expensive.

### Browser compatibility

Will it work for all your customers, even on mobile? Is supporting 95% of the most popular browsers enough? 

The answer depends on your user segment. If your top customers cannot interact with your app because they are using an old browser, you will lose money. On the other hand, supporting old browsers is expensive - developers need to create workarounds for new technologies supported only on modern browsers.

### Third-party solution integrations

Can you make your app seamlessly work with your current business tech? There is no point in reinventing the wheel and you will always have to choose: build vs buy. 

Betting on a wrong horse can be expensive. A perfect example of a typical paid third party solution is credit card payment processing. Unless you want to be a new credit card processor, it’s better to pay for the heavy lifting - and your tech needs to be able to easily implement ready-made solutions.

### Flexibility

Some concepts will change during development and you need to account for it. Brand new projects usually try ideas which are not present on the market yet or are not very popular. Oftentimes there is not enough analytics data - you aim for something new, with the client segment not defined very precisely. 

At this stage, the only thing you know is that “the only constant thing is change”. In short - the development process must be very agile.

- The concept will change a few times during development - this is unavoidable.
- The code quality must be high - low quality might force developers to rewrite extensive parts of code on big changes.
- An experienced dev team is crucial as they can suggest the best solutions.

### Too fancy tech stack 

Project tech is amazing, but poor business-wise. Developers focus on technical details, but even if it’s all bells and whistles - if it’s not valuable for you, you will not use it anyway. 

Overly excited developers want to try new tech even if it is not tested in battle. You are left with weird custom solutions without support and nobody knows how to proceed from there. Future maintenance might also be a challenge.

Solving a business problem must always be your first priority. A top-notch, modern Single Page Application might be overkill, especially if a simple static web page can work just fine and it will start making money sooner.

Regardless of your tech stack choice, future expansion must be possible without special commitments.

### Visibility in search

Discoverability often decides if a business thrives or tanks. To be visible in search engines, your app must be easily accessible for automated web crawlers. Developers have great influence on Search Engine Optimization (SEO) - you can read more [here](https://www.netguru.com/blog/developers-impact-seo-ranking).

### Security

An HTTPS connection in 2019 is a must. If you cannot see a closed padlock in your URL bar, you should back off immediately. It’s important to be sure that sensitive information is stored securely. You will never know who will try to reverse-engineer your web app on the client side. For example, storing raw personal data in browser cookies is a big no-no.

Double check if your app is protected against the most popular front-end attacks - malicious input values during form submissions help hackers steal business data every day.

### Can everybody use it?

Accessibility is the practice of making your application usable to as many users as possible, even if their abilities are limited in some way. Web, by design, is implemented to work for all people, but developers without the proper knowledge can break it all. Accessibility is required by law for many industries ([source](https://www.powermapper.com/blog/government-accessibility-standards/)).

## What can go wrong with people

Software development is considered a team effort. No one is able to develop your product alone -  you need a number of people behind the scenes who will be responsible for different areas of the development process. A good software development company provides all the vital roles.

Let’s think about the scenarios that may become reality when building a new product:

### Poor planning, poor product development cycle

No MVP (Minimum Viable Product ) - the team creates great solution and takes care of all the details, but you have nothing to show to the investors for the next 6 months. There is no runway left and the product dies before it reaches its first users.

You need to have your processes worked out and written down **before** you get to work. Determine the duration of iterations, velocity of releases, and communication rules. Read more in our [Project Management Ebook](https://www.netguru.com/project-management-ebook).

### Developers without a consulting mindset

Great developers, but poor communicators or, even worse, passive ones who agree to everything the client says despite him being wrong. In the end, they unthinkingly deliver all features required by the client, which end up being redone or even removed due to users’ complaints.

You come to a software development company with an idea that you would like to bring to life. It is the people that will work on the project who can and should tell you what works and what doesn’t. These people should guide you to success. An experienced developer is also a consultant who will advise or stop you from executing bad ideas.

### The team is not cohesive and lacks teamwork-oriented developers

A great developer with poor teamwork skills, a “typical freelancer”, delivers a lot of code but doesn’t support other teammates. He’s stubborn, bossy, and creates a toxic atmosphere which, on a long enough timeline, crashes the project - morale drops and the team is conflicted, delivering less and less.

Everybody has to make decisions as a team. In a team, you make decisions as a group. The team decides what to do based on available data, priorities, etc. This may be a process, a task priority, a deadline, anything. A champion team will always beat a team of champions.

### Non-expendable developers

A great developer who will quickly change jobs, taking all the project experience and knowledge with him. You will be left with a skeleton of your product and without any know-how.

During different stages of the development process, you will need different abilities from the people involved. After some time, the presence of a product designer may become less useful, while developers will have more work to do. In order to feel secure about your product’s development, you need to have the option to switch roles in the process.

You also need to take into account the fact that people will take days off, they will fall ill, and some of them will even leave the company altogether. None of these events should affect the development process. Having some additional people on the players’ bench will guarantee consistency and continuity of work.
